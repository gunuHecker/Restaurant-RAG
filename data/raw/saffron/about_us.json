The Saffron chain epitomizes the royal experience in flavour, aroma and purity. It was first of its kind as it introduced the unique ” do it yourself ” concept in dining. Saffron’s dining experience comes complete with a grill at the centre of the table and variety of starters skewered and ready for the guests to marinate according to taste and then grill or roast to perfection. This customized dining has been getting a stupendous response from connoisseurs of good food. In fact Saffron has established a stellar customer base that speaks of its popularity.",
